The image contains a recipe. Perform OCR.
If the recipe is in a different language, translate it to Dutch.
Then correct the structure, grammar, and spelling for the following recipe. It was extracted with OCR, so ingredients and directions may be out of order. Do not paraphrase. Include all the original directions. Format the recipe in JSON and ensure it is a valid JSON. The following rules MUST be followed:
1) Ingredients require both note and display. They should be the same value.
2) Ingredients MUST have a referenceId which is a UUIDv4. Generate a unique one per ingredient.
3) Instructions should be broken down into discreet steps with grammar and spelling
4) Instructions MUST have an ingredientReferences property which should be set to an empty array like `"ingredientReferences": []`. DO NOT MAP INGREDIENTS.
5) Notes require both a title and text. It should include an import statement, changelog, as well as commentary. Be opportunistic about your commentary. If there are no corrections, there is no need to include it in the notes.
The possible attributes are as follows: name, description, recipeYield, totalTime, prepTime, cookTime, preformTime, recipeIngredient, recipeInstructions, and notes.
